This section will show how we unconsciously collapse our ap- plication structures by using design patterns to increase flexibility and let rigidity creep in to our designs.  ~5 minutes.\n* The Strategy Pattern. The Strategy pattern enables us to select algorithms at runtime, but this comes with at the cost of forcing classes to have knowledge about the contexts in which these algorithms are used. Focusing on the implementation of a commonly used pattern drives attention to- wards how we can implement the same pattern with different means, which will be one of the themes for the rest of the talk.\n* The Collapse of Application Structure. Our implementations of common design patterns causes a ΄pattern lock-in‘ that can fragment domain logic and blur out the distinction between domain and in- frastructure logic. This can hurt the maintainability of our applications.  Making Roles Explicit. This section will focus on improving the design of a domain model’s internals to achieve better separation of concerns and improved flexibility and maintainability.  ~15 minutes\n* Our Objects Play Too Many Roles. Our domain objects, especially Aggregates, often violate sound software engineering principles. The upside of this is that it gives developers using these a better experience, the downside is that it hurts maintainability.  In this section I will show how the common validation patterns we use in our models violates the single responsibility principle and eschew domain concepts.\n* Refactoring to Explicit Roles. In this section I will show how to separate the concerns in the previ- ous section into domain objects and services that adhere to the single responsibility principle and makes the solution more extensible.\n* Data Access is Infrastructure.  This section will focus on improving the architecture of an application by clearly distinguishing between domain logic and infrastructure code. Towards the end we connect the dots by combining the lessons from this section with the ones form the previous section.  ~20 minutes\n* Don’t Repeat Yourself! In domain driven design we use Repositories to abstract the data access layer. Different Repositories often share the same behavior and their implementations often violate the DRY principle. In this section I will show how to refactor the repository concepts into an application’s supporting infrastructure to increase productivity, reusability and maintainability without sacrificing the flexibility of hand-rolled repositories.\n* Lazy About Lazy Loading. Repositories are commonly used in conjunction with object/relational mappers to increase separation of concerns. As the real-world concerns of software development manifest themselves, these abstractions start to leak and soon our domain services get tainted with fetching strategies and similar. In this section I will show how we can combine the concepts from previous sections with Inversion of Control to keep our models clean.\n* Wrap up. In this section the emphasis is on separation of concerns, the DRY-principle and the importance of keeping roles explicit.  ~5 minutes\n\nh1.

Making certain that memory consumption is dynamically adjusted to avoid out of memory situations? Would you also like to use it in your legacy applications running pre Java 5 as well as utilize the new Java agent interface of the newer JVMs? \n\nYou know you have to collect vast amount of data and process it effectively and in real \ntime.

Usemon comes with a complete \nconfiguration for MySQL. \n\nThe overhead of running Usemon is negligible and thus you may collect run-time \nstatistics around the clock all year, which is rather fascinating, given that you have \nenough disk space. \n\nUsemon was developed for large Java EE environments at Telenor, which is one of the \nworlds largest telco to fulfill these requirements.

Abstract\n\nDeltakerne på denne sesjonen vil få innsikt i praksiser for effektivt å kommunisere og prioritere krav, estimere kostnader og gjennomføre utviklingsprosjekter. Ettersom dette er temaer uten fasitsvar legges det opp til mye diskusjon og interaksjon.\n\nProgramvareprosjekter mislykkes ofte med å levere lovede resultater, og kostnadsoverskridelser er en stor og hyppig utfordring. Mangelfull kravhåndtering er ofte en underliggende årsak til disse utfordringene. Det finnes imidlertid en rekke indikasjoner på at gode samarbeidspraksiser kan redusere omfanget på problemet. Det har vært anslått at samarbeid og kommunikasjon utgjør opptil 70% av den totale tidsbruken i programvareprosjekter, og  å anbefale en høy andel av samarbeid og kundeinvolvering er derfor ikke noe nytt. Utfordringen er imidlertid å identifisere hva som utgjør et godt samarbeid, og hvordan dette kan oppnås.\n\nMange utviklingsorganisasjoner benytter seg i økende grad av iterative og inkrementelle prosesser, for eksempel Scrum. Imidlertid har også de smidige prosessene, og andre prosesser slik som RUP, mangler når det gjelder å involvere sentrale aktører som kunder, interaksjonseksperter og brukertestere. De iterative og inkrementelle prosessene er unektelig bedre utrustet enn de sekvensielle prosessene (fossefall) når det kommer til å håndtere disse behovene, men de er samtidig også langt mer innstilt på å tilfredsstille behovene til utviklingsteamet.\n\nDenne sesjonen skisserer samarbeidspraksiser vi mener øker sjansen for verdiskapning i utviklingsprosjekter.

Denne pyramiden skiller mellom fem generiske nivåer for kommunikasjon om krav, som er nyttig i de fleste prosjekter.

Abstract:\n\nMario Aparicio og Eirik R. Larsen fra Ciber presenterer erfaringer med bruk av webrammeverket Seam og prosessmotoren jBPM. \n\nVRVask er et system utviklet av CIBER Norge for validering, manuell korrigering, og rapportering av store antall banktransaksjoner. Systemet er todelt og består av en batch-applikasjon og en web-applikasjon som kommuniserer gjennom en felles database. \n\nFor utvikling av web-applikasjonen ble webrammeverket Seam valgt. Bakgrunnen for dette valget er Seams abstraksjon av request / response modellen og støtte for lange brukerinteraksjoner, conversations. Batch-delen av løsningen ble utviklet som en standard Java-applikasjon med Spring og Hibernate.\n\nVi opplevde Seam som et godt valg av rammeverk for web-løsningen da det gav enkel integrasjon mellom webgrensesnitt, domene og database. På enkelte områder støtte vi imidlertid på utfordringer som muligens kunne vært løst bedre med andre rammeverk.  \n\nI utviklingen av batch-løsningen var Spring og Hibernate velegnede rammeverk for håndtering av database og dependency-injection. Derimot fikk vi problemer med håndtering av tilstandslogikk i batch-prosessen. Kompleksiteten ble undervurdert, og vi endte opp med å lagre tilstand i databasen og håndtere all tilstandslogikk programmatisk. Løsningen ble derfor vanskelig å utvikle og vedlikeholde. Etter å ha analysert problemene i batch-løsningen så vi at en prosessmotor med fordel kunne brukes for å håndtere tilstand. Vi valgte å se på prosessverktøyet jBPM da dette er et mye utprøvd verktøy som fungerer bra i et Java-miljø. jBPM er i tillegg godt integrert med andre JBoss-produkter som Hibernate og Seam. \n\nI presentasjonen beskriver vi positive og negative erfaringer med Seam i prosjektet og drøfter når det er fornuftig å bruke dette rammeverket fremfor andre web-rammeverk. Videre presenterer vi hvilke fordeler vi kan oppnå ved å bruke jBPM, og hvilke alternativer man har når man skal innføre et slikt verktøy i tilstandsfulle applikasjoner.

Abstract:\n\nWhen the Spring framework hit the marked, it revolutionized the way we build our applications. Dependency injection, and inversion of control became well known terms, and it is difficult to imagine how we managed without them. But there is one aspect of the Spring framework that has been fiercely discussed for a long time; What is the best approach to configuring our applications for deployment in multiple environments?\n\nI have struggeled with this problem since my first encounter with the Spring framework, and over the years I have tried just about all the techniques there are.

Of course, there's no way that we'd leave metaprogramming out of the discussion...\n\nWhat is metaprogramming? We'll add new methods to classes at runtime -- even if they were originally implemented in Java; even if they were declared final. (Thanks, ExpandoMetaClass!) We'll call methods that don't exist and avoid the dreaded MethodNotFound Exception. (Thanks, invokeMethod!) We'll narrowly scope our metaprogramming shenanigans using Use blocks and Categories, and then cast our changes to the wind such that every instance of a class gets our added juice.\n\nIf you are happy taking the Blue Pill, this talk is not for you. You can continue using Groovy as a slimmed-down dialect of Java -- an \"After\" picture to Java's \"Before\". If, however, the Red Pill looks interesting, please join me. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.\n\nh1. Expected audience:\nThis session is aimed squarely at Java developers.

You should understand the basic \"Laws of Java\" when it comes to the semantics of a statically typed language (so that we can kick sand in its face). Most importantly, you should posses an open mind and a belly full of Dynamic-language KoolAid. This is not the forum for someone to vocally defend the merits of checked exceptions and static typing. You will be unceremoniously tossed out on your ear, Jerry Springer-style. Seriously. I'm not trying to convince you that this is the way you should write Java.

We'll talk about calling Java classes from Groovy, and calling Groovy classes from Java. We'll look at Groovyc, the integrated compiler that manages Groovy/Java dependencies without a hiccup.\n\nThere are wild-eyed radicals out there telling you that Java is dead, statically-typed languages are passe, and your skills are hopelessly out-of-date. Those extremists are the same ones who don't bat an eye at throwing out years of experience to learn a new language from scratch, pushing aside a familiar IDE for a new one, and deploying to a whole new set of production servers with little regard to legacy integration.\n\nWhile this \"burn the boats\" approach to software development might sound exciting to some folks, it's giving your manager the cold shakes right now. What if I told you that there was a way that you could integrate seamlessly with your legacy Java code, continue to use your trusty IDE and stable production servers, and yet take advantage of many of the exciting new dynamic language features that those fanatics keep prattling on about? You'd probably say, \"Groovy!\" I would, too...\n\nNot once will I tell you to throw out the old in favor of the new. In each case, I'll show you how to integrate the new with the old. Don't throw out your Ant build scripts; mix in a bit of Groovy to spice 'em up. Don't toss out your existing unit tests. (You are unit testing, aren't you? AREN'T YOU?) If not, Groovy is the perfect excuse to get started with a new language in way that improves the quality of your Java application without actually putting the new code into production. That is, until you get hooked on doing things the Groovy way...\n\nIf the Red Pill of Dynamic Languages scares the pants off of you (or your manager), don't worry about it. The Blue Pill still offers plenty of benefits. There is no other language on the JVM that offers you the level of deep Java compatibility such that you could rename your \"dot J-A-V-A\" files to \"dot G-R-O-O-V-Y\" and not skip a beat. Of course, they both end up with a \"dot C-L-A-S-S\" extension at the end of the day, so there's good chance that no one would ever be the wiser anyway.

Rammebetingelsene for prosjektet var at kartserveren\nskulle være Java-basert og åpen kilde, slik at det ville være mulig å\ngjøre tilpasninger dersom det skulle være nødvendig. Videre var bare\nrene serverløsninger relevant siden klienten kom til å være\negenutviklet.

Det ble vurdert å utvikle en\negen kartklient i SWING, men dette ble forkastet på grunn av\nbegrensningene for minneforbruk i kjøremiljøet. Dette førte på sin tur\ntil et behov for å kunne sende kartdata fra web-basert kartklient til\nSWING-klient, som ble løst ved å la kartklienten gjøre et HTTP-kall\ntil SWING-klienten via en skjult IFRAME.

The second part is the internal quality, also known as technical quality. This\nis the quality seen by the software engineers. The testing of software is often only\nbased on functional testing. Because the functional testing is driven by the functional\nrequirements, the functional quality is easy to test and easy to measure. The\ntechnical part of the software is almost ignored, because the technical quality is\nharder to test. But the technical quality directly affects the functional quality.\nSometimes you have non-functional requirements like response time for a certain\nfunction, but other non-functional requirements, like maintainability, are not\nmeasured.\nThe talk will give the attendees ideas how to “test” or measure the technical quality of\ntheir software. I will give answers concerning basic questions on software quality,\nsource code, object model, software metrics and their relationship. I will give a short\nintroduction into basic terms and I will give a short overview on basic metrics and\nmetrics on a higher, aggregated level.

Outline\n\nIn the past two years I presented the talks “The Top 10 Ways to Botch an Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application” and “The Top 10 Ways to Botch Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application Scalability and Reliability”. Now that people have plenty of expertise on how to botch their applications, I wanted to shift focus from anti-patterns to patterns. The \"Top 10\" theme remains as it keeps a quick pace and enforces a quick distillation of complex topics into simple concepts for the audience to remember.\n\nIn this presentation I will use real world examples to demonstrate the challenges, solutions, and unexpected discoveries architects find when building scalable Java applications. I will site actual scenarios where each pattern has been used, and explain what the driving forces were behind these choices. (This talk consciously steers clear of discussing website scaling via content caching, as this is a topic well-covered by many whitepapers, presentations and other conferences.\n\nA few examples:\n\nFor example, working on an ultra-low-latency JavaSpaces-based trading application was one of our first exposures to Recovery-Oriented Computing (ROC) for transaction processing in a production environment. The ROC concept can be used to achieve otherwise impossible results by selectively persisting only critical system state. Prior to this, we had generally steered clear of non-replicated in-memory data. But applying the ROC concept allowed us to achieve an order-of-magnitude latency improvement over what even the most efficient replicated-memory approach would have allowed, without compromising system availability.\n\nLikewise, working with a high-volume clearing application, a partner discovered that while serializable database isolation was required from a business perspective, and their database of choice enforced this optimistically, performing initial locking in-memory minimized the number of transaction rollbacks, substantially increasing system throughput.\n\nMuch of this experience was acquired while working with customers in the usual early-adopter sectors: websites for retail, travel and hospitality; transaction processing and compute grids in investment banks; and more recently, the rush of so-called \"Web 2.0\" startups. While in most of these cases, the primary reason for being onsite with the customer was the Coherence product that I am involved with, many of the more interesting lessons came from working with 3rd party products from dozens of vendors and open source communities, and learning alternate solutions to common problems from the people involved with those products.\n\nh1.

The new resource serving feature allows a portlet to deliver personalized resources to the browser such as images or PDF documents based on the current user preferences and profile, it also offers the capability to serve markup fragments from a portlet providing support for ajax portlet development.
